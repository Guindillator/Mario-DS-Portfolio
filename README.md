# Hi, It's a me, Mario! üëã

I'm a Data Scientist with a passion for transforming data into meaningful, actionable insights. With a background in [bioinformatics], I bring a distinctive approach to solving complex problems through data analysis and machine learning.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse array of projects, from [description of one type of project] to [description of another type of project]. This experience has allowed me to develop strong skills in areas like [list of skills], as well as a deep understanding of how to leverage data to drive strategic decision-making.

## About Me üìå
I'm a passionate biologist turned data scientist, leveraging my academic background and love for research to extract insights from complex datasets. Equipped with a solid foundation in Biology and Bioinformatics, I ventured into the realm of Data Science to unveil the mysteries hidden in big data.

## Experience üë®‚Äçüíº

- **Data Scientist**, _Ministerio de Defensa Espa√±ol_, April 2021 - Present
  - As a Senior Data Scientist, I am proficient in complex data analysis and processing, leadership, project management, and have a deep knowledge of NLP, clustering, deep learning, data mining, and data visualization.
  
- **Postdoctoral Researcher**, _Centro de Biotecnolog√≠a y Gen√≥mica de Plantas_, July 2020 - March 2021
  - Worked as a Data Steward at the European Joint Programme on Rare Diseases, ensuring proper management of research data related to rare diseases. Promoted data sharing and collaboration, and resolved data quality issues.

- **Python Developer**, _FAIR Data Systems_, July 2020 - March 2021
  - More details coming soon!
  
- **Researcher**, _Centro de Biotecnolog√≠a y Gen√≥mica de Plantas_, September 2015 - November 2019
  - Worked on the Quality and Trust from Provenance in E-Science project, focusing on NLP, sentiment analysis, text mining, clustering, and neural networks.

## Education üéì
- **Master Expert in Data Science and Big Data**, _Datahack School_, November 2022 - March 2023
  - Specializations: Data Discovery, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Visualization, Docker, Kubernetes, NoSQL, Hadoop, Spark
- **Ph.D. in Bioinformatics**, _Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid_, 2015 - 2019
  - My thesis focused on discerning the levels of certainty in scholarly writing and creating automated classifiers to capture certainty through Deep Learning. Also developed Biocertainty, a Python package that applies captured certainty to novel scholarly statements.
- **Master in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology**, _Escuela Nacional de Sanidad - Instituto de Salud Carlos III_, 2014 - 2015
  - Specialization: Artificial Intelligence
- **Bachelor's Degree in Biology**, _Universidad de Sevilla_, 2010 - 2014
